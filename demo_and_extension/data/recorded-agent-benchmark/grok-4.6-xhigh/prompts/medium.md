# Grok 4.6 xhigh recorded blind run - Medium

You are the sole visual player for one scored OpenGuessr competition. Complete
the entire Medium competition in the already prepared browser tab. There are
exactly 9 rounds, each with 300 seconds. The recorder dataset is
`europe-medium`; the exact participant label is
`grok-4.6-xhigh-recorded`.

Do not finish this response until all 9 rounds are submitted, the final
Continue action has produced a numeric leaderboard row, and the recorder has
been explicitly disarmed with exactly 9 saved rounds. If a pre-entry blocker
prevents a safe start, stop before Confirm and report only the rendered visual
blocker.

## Absolute evidence and tool boundary

Solve only from pixels in full current-viewport screenshots. Ordinary labels
that visibly render inside the in-game panorama or guess map are allowed.
General geographic reasoning from those pixels is allowed. Everything else is
prohibited evidence.

You may call only these six tools:

- `playwright__browser_take_screenshot`
- `playwright__browser_mouse_click_xy`
- `playwright__browser_mouse_move_xy`
- `playwright__browser_mouse_drag_xy`
- `playwright__browser_mouse_wheel`
- `playwright__browser_press_key`

For every screenshot, call it as a full current-viewport image with no
`element`, `target`, `filename`, or `fullPage` argument; use only
`{"scale":"css"}`. Base every coordinate on the most recent screenshot and
take another screenshot after every action. Do not chain actions whose visible
effects have not been checked. Keyboard input is permitted only after a
visible coordinate click focuses an in-page control. Never use Ctrl/Meta/Alt
shortcuts, clipboard shortcuts, the address bar, refresh, DevTools, or a
navigation shortcut.

This dedicated scored browser has been measured through this exact Playwright
screenshot path at **1527x780 CSS pixels**. Use the fixed valid grid
`x=0..1526`, `y=0..779`; do not guess another canvas size. If a returned image
is visibly clipped or has different dimensions, stop before acting. Choose
every geographic point directly from the newest screenshot.

Never use or request browser snapshots, accessibility data, DOM/element refs,
find, locators, selectors, evaluation, Playwright code, page source, console,
network data, storage, cookies, metadata, files, shell, repository content,
web/search tools, subagents, another site, geocoding, reverse-image search, or
prior run results. Never inspect or reason from the address, competition URL,
query string, competition ID, pano ID, coordinates, page title, or any hidden
value. If the MCP response envelope automatically prints a Page URL, Page
Title, or other non-pixel text, ignore it completely: do not quote, interpret,
compare, store, or reason from it. A denied tool is a hard boundary, not a
reason to seek a workaround.

## Recorder gate - before exposing round 1

The disposable controller preflight has already passed. Your very first
screenshot is also a bridge-binding barrier: the centered competition modal
may still show the recorder setup panel behind it rather than `ARMED`. If so,
do not click or press anything and do not stop. Take another full-viewport
screenshot until the coordinator has visibly changed that same panel to
`ARMED`. This brief wait supplies no geographic evidence. Never alter, stop,
or reconfigure the recorder and never open another tab or practice round.

1. Start from the centered visible `Enter competition?` modal and screenshot
   it before any action. Do not close the modal with X. If the panel is not yet
   `ARMED`, remain completely passive and repeat only this screenshot.
2. Visibly verify the upper-right recorder panel behind it says `ARMED` and
   shows `0 rounds saved · europe-medium · grok-4.6-xhigh-recorded ·
   interactive`. If any field differs or an error is visible, stop before
   Confirm and report the rendered blocker.
3. Click only the modal's visible red Confirm control and screenshot the first
   rendered round. On the fixed 1527x780 grid, the already pixel-calibrated
   center of that pre-entry Confirm control is `x=981, y=470`; use that point
   once. Confirm is authorized only after the ARMED verification.
4. Before any map pin, movement, or Guess, require the rendered game footer to
   visibly identify a Competition at round `1/9` and the timer to begin near
   `5:00`. A Daily Competition, `1/1`, or roughly two-minute timer is the wrong
   flow: stop immediately without Guess and report the rendered blocker.

During every live round, visibly verify the HUD says `REC`. After each result,
verify the saved-round counter advanced by exactly one and/or the visible
`SAVED` state is present before continuing. Never hide, disable, bypass, or
prematurely disarm the recorder.

## Required round state machine

For each of the 9 rounds, use this short sequence:

Controller-speed rule: during a live round, do not use mouse move, drag, wheel,
or optional Street View exploration after the first meaningful pin is visible.
Once a screenshot shows a belief-matched marker on named land/city with active
Guess, your very next action MUST be Guess. The only exception is one direct
marker correction when that screenshot proves the pin is offshore, default,
or inconsistent with your written belief. Never refine a valid pin. Have a pin
placed by `3:30` and submit by `3:00`; if time reaches either threshold, choose
the best visible named land/city immediately rather than continuing analysis.

1. `SCENE_READY`: take one untouched whole-frame screenshot. Record up to five
   strongest visible cues, your initial belief, alternatives, and confidence.
   If the recorder is still `ARMED` instead of `REC`, wait one screenshot and,
   only if necessary, take at most one ordinary Street View step to trigger
   `REC`. Do nothing else before `REC` is visible.
2. `PIN`: immediately open the guess map and place the first meaningful
   non-default pin matching your current belief on visible named land or a
   visible named city. Prefer a robust country/city pin over risky precision.
3. `VERIFY`: take one screenshot. Require the marker tip to be on land or the
   named city matching your written belief and require Guess to be active.
   Correct at most once, and only if the marker is visibly offshore, default,
   or inconsistent with your belief. A coarse but belief-matched land/city pin
   is valid and must be submitted without zooming or panning.
4. `SUBMIT`: click Guess immediately at that verified marker and screenshot.
   Do not collapse/reopen the map, explore after a valid pin, or attempt
   optional precision refinement. After the first belief-matched verified pin,
   allow at most one correction screenshot and submit no later than `3:00`
   remaining. Retry Guess only if the screenshot proves the click was swallowed.
5. `RESULT_SAVED`: record the rendered distance, revealed location, semantic
   correctness, belief-to-pin consistency, and any controller issue. Treat XP
   animation separately from official points. Wait until recorder `SAVED` and
   the saved count advances exactly once, then click visible Continue once.

## Finalization gate

After round 9's result and recorder save verification, remain on that exact
result screen and click its visible Continue control. If it is swallowed,
screenshot and retry that same control once. Do not navigate directly anywhere.
Completion requires a rendered leaderboard row for the current player with a
numeric official total.

Keep the numeric leaderboard visible for at least two screenshot/heartbeat
cycles and verify no phantom Round 10 begins. Only then click the recorder HUD's
visible `Done & disarm`, or `Stop recording` if that is the terminal control.
Verify exactly 9 saved rounds and that the HUD disappears. Do not leave earlier.

Your final response must include one compact record per round with exactly the
headings `INITIAL`, `PROVISIONAL PIN`, `FINAL BELIEF + PIN`, and `RESULT`, then
the separate terminal headings `FINAL ROUND RESULT`, `FINAL CONTINUE CLICKED`,
`LEADERBOARD COMMITTED`, and `RECORDER DONE`. Include the official total,
round count, saved count, valid-marker count, timeouts/defaults, semantic
outcomes, belief-to-pin outcomes, distances, swallowed actions, and any honest
uncertainty.
